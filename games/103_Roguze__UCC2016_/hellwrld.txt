YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO DESCEND TO TARTARUS TO CLAIM THE SOURCE OF AMBROSIA AND NECTAR.GOOD LUCK.                            PRESS START                     WELCOME TO ROGUZE.            THE WORLD IS RULED BY FALSE GODS. THEY ARE NOT ALL POWERFULL. THEY CAN BE DEFEATED. YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO DESCEND TO TARTARUS TO CLAIM THE SOURCE OF AMBROSIA AND NECTAR.GOOD LUCK.                   PGAIA LAY WITH OURANOS AND BARE DEEP-SWIRLING OKEANOS, KOIOS, KRIOS, HYPERION, IAPETOS, THEIA, RHEA, THEMIS, MNEMOSYNE, GOLD-CROWNED PHOIBE AND LOVELY TETHYS. AFTER THEM WAS BORN KRONOS. HELIOS WHOM MILD-EYED THEIA, THE FAR-SHINING ONE, BARE TO THE SON OF GAIA AND STARRY OURANOS. FOR HYPERION WEDDED GLORIOUS THEIA, HIS OWN SISTER, WHO BARE HIM LOVELY CHILDREN, RICH-TRESSED SELENE, TIRELESS HELIOS, AND ROSY ARMED EOS WHO SHINES UPON ALL THAT ARE ON EARTH AND UPON THE DEATHLESS GODS WHO LIVE IN THE WIDE HEAVEN
MNEMOSYNE, A DAUGHTER OF URANUS, AND ONE OF THE TITANIDES, BECAME BY ZEUS THE MOTHER OF THE MUSES. ZEUS, AFTER LYING WITH DEMETER LOVED MNEMOSYNE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR AND OF HER THE NINE GOLD-CROWNED MOISAI WERE BORN. MNEMOSYNE, BEAR UNION WITH THE FATHER, THE SON OF KRONOS, A FORGETTING OF ILLS AND A REST FROM SORROW. FOR NINE NIGHTS DID ZEUS LIE WITH HER, ENTERING HER HOLY BED REMOTE FROM THE IMMORTALS. SHE BARE NINE DAUGHTERS, OF ONE MIND, WHOSE HEARTS ARE SET UPON SONG AND THEIR SPIRIT FREE FROM CARE
PHOIBE  CAME TO THE DESIRED EMBRACE OF KOIOS. THEN THE GODDESS THROUGH THE LOVE OF THE GOD CONCEIVED AND BROUGHT FORTH DARK GOWNED LETO.  LETO WAS RACKED NINE DAYS AND NINE NIGHTS WITH PANGS BEYOND WONT. AND THERE WERE WITH HER THE CHIEFEST OF THE GODDESSES, DIONE, RHEIA, IKHNAIE, THEMIS, LOUD MOANING AMPHITRITE AND OTHER DEATHLESS GODDESSES. GREAT PHOIBOS, THE GODDESSES WASHED YOU PURELY AND CLEANLY WITH SWEET WATER, AND SWATHED YOU IN A WHITE GARMENT OF FINE TEXTURE, AND FASTENED A GOLDEN BAND ABOUT YOU.
RHEA WAS SUBJECT IN LOVE TO KRONOS AND BARE SPLENDID CHILDREN, HESTIA, DEMETER, AND GOLD-SHOD HERA AND STRONG HAIDES AND THE LOUD CRASHING EARTH SHAKER, AND WISE ZEUS AND ALL SEEING ZEUS SENT A MESSENGER TO THEM [DEMETER AND PERSEPHONE, AFTER THE DAUGHTER HAD BEEN RETURNED FROM THE UNDERWORLD], RICH-HAIRED RHEIA, TO BRING DARK-CLOAKED DEMETER TO JOIN THE FAMILIES OF THE GODS.AND THE GODDESS DID NOT DISOBEY THE MESSAGE OF ZEUS, SWIFTLY SHE RUSHED DOWN FROM THE PEAKS OF OLYMPOS AND CAME TO THE PLAIN OF RHAROS
TETHYS BROUGHT FORTH ALSO A RACE APART OF DAUGHTERS OKEANIDES, WHO WITH LORD APOLLON AND THE RIVERS HAVE THE YOUNG IN THEIR KEEPING ALL OVER THE EARTH, SINCE THIS RIGHT FROM ZEUS IS GIVEN THEM. TITAN TETHYS WAS ONCE MARRIED TO OKEANOS, WHOSE TRANSLUCENT WATERS SCARF THE BROAD EARTH. THEIR CHILD PLEIONE COUPLES WITH SKY LIFTING ATLAS AND BEARS THE PLEIADES. O TETHYS! AGEMATE AND BEDMATE OF OKEANOS, ANCIENT AS THE WORLD, NURSE OF COMMINGLED WATERS, SELFBORN, LOVING MOTHER OF CHILDREN, WHAT SHALL WE DO? 
NEXT AFTER METIS HE ZEUS LED AWAY BRIGHT THEMIS WHO BARE THE HORAI , AND EUNOMIA, DIKE , AND BLOOMING EIRENE, WHO MIND THE WORKS OF MORTAL MEN, AND THE MOIRAI TO WHOM WISE ZEUS GAVE THE GREATEST HONOUR, KLOTHO, AND LAKHESIS, AND ATROPOS  WHO GIVE MORTAL MEN EVIL AND GOOD TO HAVE. WHEN ZEUS THUNDERED AND BRANDISHED HIS THUNDERBOLT, THE MOIRAI AND THEMIS  STOPPED HIM. IT WAS IMPIOUS FOR ANYONE TO DIE THERE. WICKED MEN NEVER ELUDE PURE THEMIS, NIGHT AND DAY HER EYES ARE ON THEM. SING IN PRAISE OF HOLY THEMIS  
HYPERION WEDDED GLORIOUS EURYPHAESSA, HIS OWN SISTER, WHO BARE HIM LOVELY CHILDREN, ROSY-ARMED EOS AND RICH-TRESSED SELENE AND TIRELESS HELIOS. MY CHILDREN, GOTTEN OF A SINFUL FATHER, IF YOU WILL OBEY ME, WE SHOULD PUNISH THE VILE OUTRAGE OF YOUR FATHER, FOR HE FIRST THOUGHT OF DOING SHAMEFUL THINGS. SO SHE SAID, BUT FEAR SEIZED THEM ALL, AND NONE OF THEM UTTERED A WORD. BUT GREAT KRONOS THE WILY TOOK COURAGE AND ANSWERED HIS DEAR MOTHER  MOTHER, I WILL UNDERTAKE TO DO THIS DEED.                            
THE UNDERMOST LIMITS OF EARTH AND SEA, WHERE IAPETOS AND KRONOS  SEATED HAVE NO SHINING OF THE SUN GOD HYPERION TO DELIGHT THEM NOR WINDS' DELIGHT, BUT TARTAROS  STANDS DEEPLY ABOUT THEM. NOW IAPETOS TOOK TO WIFE THE NEAT-ANKLED MAID KLYMENE , DAUGHTER OF OKEANOS, AND WENT UP WITH HER INTO ONE BED. AND SHE BARE HIM A STOUT HEARTED SON, ATLAS: ALSO SHE BARE VERY GLORIOUS MENOITIOS AND CLEVER PROMETHEUS, FULL OF VARIOUS WILES, AND SCATTER-BRAINED EPIMETHEUS. AFTER BATTLE WITH FIERCE IAPETUS ZEUS WAS RULED.   
COEUS IN THE LOWEST PIT BURST THE ADAMANTINE BONDS AND TRAILING ZEUS CHAINS INVOKES KRONOS AND TITYUS, AND IN HIS MADNESS CONCEIVES A HOPE OF SCALING HEAVEN, YET THOUGH HE REPASS THE RIVERS AND THE GLOOM THE HOUND KERBEROS OF THE FURIAI AND THE SPRAWLING HYDRA'S CREST REPEL HIM. GE (EARTH), DISTRESSED BY THE LOSS OF HER CHILDREN INTO TARTAROS, PERSUADED THE TITANES KOIOS, HYPERION, KREIOS, IAPETOS AND KRONOS TO ATTACK OURANOS, KRONOS WITH A SICKLE OF ADAMANT, AND HIS BROTHERS EXCEPT OKEANOS SET UPON OURANOS
EURYBIA, BRIGHT GODDESS, WAS JOINED IN LOVE TO KRIOS AND BARE GREAT ASTRAIOS , AND PALLAS, AND PERSES. WHEN HELIOS REACHES KRIOS , THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE, THE NAVEL-STAR OF OLYMPOS, I HELIOS IN MY EXALTATION LET THE SPRING INCREASE. KRIOS THE RAM HEADED, PILLAR OF THE EARTH, WHO ORDERS MEASURES OF THE YEAR. THE POETS SAY THAT THE VICTIM OF APOLLON WAS A DRAKON POSTED BY GE TO BE A GUARD FOR THE ORACLE. IT IS ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS A VIOLENT SON OF KRIOS , A MAN WITH AUTHORITY AROUND EUBOIA.              
AS FOR THE OLYMPIAKOS GAMES, THE MOST LEARNED ANTIQUARIANS OF ELIS SAY THAT KRONOS WAS THE FIRST KING OF HEAVEN, AND THAT IN HIS HONOUR A TEMPLE WAS BUILT IN OLYMPIA BY THE MEN OF THAT AGE, WHO WERE NAMED THE GOLDEN RACE. WHEN KRONOS WAS HUNTING ZEUS THROUGHOUT THE EARTH, ASSUMING THE FORM OF A STEED HE LAY WITH PHILYRA, DAUGHTER OF OCEANUS. BY HIM SHE BORE CHIRON THE CENTAUR, WHO IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO INVENT THE ART OF HEALING. IN THE UNDERMOST LIMITS OF EARTH AND SEA, TARTAROS, STANDS KRONOS. 
IF YOUR OKEANOS MAKES YOU SO HAUGHTY, CONSIDER ERIDANOS  STRUCK BY THE BOLT OF ZEUS, YOUR BROTHER BURNT WITH FIRE : A CRUEL SORROW IT WAS FOR YOUR WATERY ANCESTOR OKEANOS, WHO IS GIRDLED BY THE WORLD'S RIM, WHO POURS ALL THOSE MIGHTY STREAMS OF WATER TO POSSES THE EARTH, WHEN HE SAW HIS OWN SON BURNT UP AND MADE NO WAR ON OLYMPOS, NOR CONTENDED WITH HIS FLOOD AGAINST THE FIREBARBED THUNDERBOLT. PRAY SPARE YOUR WATERS AWHILE, OR I MAY SEE YOU HYDASPES, BURNT UP IN FIERY FLAMES LIKE ERIDANOS.                 
AT THE BEGINNING THERE WAS ONLY KHAOS, NYX, DARK EREBOS, AND DEEP TARTAROS. GE, AER AND OURANOS AT FIRST HAD NO EXISTENCE. THE DEFEAT OF THE GIGANTES BY THE GODS ANGERED GE ALL THE MORE, SO SHE HAD INTERCOURSE WITH TARTAROS AND BORE TYPHOEUS IN KILIKIA. TARTAROS BEGAT BY TARTARA, TYPHOEUS, A CREATURE OF IMMENSE SIZE AND FEARFUL SHAPE, WHO HAD A HUNDRED DRAKON HEADS SPRINGING FROM HIS SHOULDERS. IN TARTAROS THE HUNDRED-HEADED SERPENT SHALL TEAR YOUR ENTRAILS YOUR LUNGS WILL BE ATTACKED BY THE MYRAINA TARTESI
 NYX BARE HATEFUL MOROS AND BLACK KER AND THANATOS, AND SHE BARE HYPNOS AND THE TRIBE OF ONEIROI. AND AGAIN THE GODDESS MURKY NYX, THOUGH SHE LAY WITH NONE, BARE MOMOS AND PAINFUL OIZYS, AND THE HESPERIDES. ALSO SHE BARE THE MOIRA AND THE RUTHLESS AVENGING KERES . ALSO DEADLY NYX BARE NEMESIS TO AFFLICT MORTAL MEN, AND AFTER HER, APATE AND PHILOTES AND HATEFUL GERAS  AND HARD-HEARTED ERIS .WE ARE THE ETERNAL CHILDREN OF NYX. WE ARE CALLED ARAI IN OUR HOMES BENEATH THE EARTH O NYX, OUR DARK MOTHER.          
FROM OKEANOS THEN UPROSE EOS GOLDEN-REINED LIKE A SOFT WIND UPFLOATED HYPNOS TO HEAVEN, AND THERE MET HERA. SHE CLASPED HIM ROUND, AND KISSED HIM, WHO HAD BEEN HER MARRIAGE-KIN SINCE AT HER PRAYER ON IDA'S EREST HE HAD LULLED TO SLEEP ZEUS, WHEN HIS ANGER BURNED AGAINST THE ARGIVES. HERA PASSED TO ZEUS'S MANSION, AND HYPNOS SWIFTLY FLEW TO PASITHEA'S COUCH. FROM SLUMBER WOKE ALL NATIONS. HYPNOS DRIVING NYX'S COURSERS, MET HIM AND ROSE ABASHED TO SALUTE HIS GODHEAD, TURNING ASIDE FROM HIS CELESTIAL PATH.    
FROM KHAOS CAME FORTH EREBOS  AND BLACK NYX, BUT OF NYX  WERE BORN AETHER AND HEMERA, WHOM SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE FROM UNION IN LOVE WITH EREBOS. ZEUS STRUCK MENOITIOS WITH A LURID THUNDERBOLT AND SENT HIM DOWN TO EREBOS. THE HEKATONKHEIRESWHOM ZEUS BROUGHT UP TO THE LIGHT FROM EREBOS (EREBUS) BENEATH THE EARTH. HERMES CAME BIDDING ME PERSEPHONE COME BACK FROM EREBOS. CIRCE OUT OF EREBOS AND CHAOS  CALLED NYX AND THE DI NOCTI AND POURED A PRAYER WITH LONG-DRAWN WAILING CRIES TO HEKATE.
