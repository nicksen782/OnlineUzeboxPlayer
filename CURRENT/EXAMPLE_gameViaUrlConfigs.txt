Example .json file contents:

{
 "files": [
  {"filename":"gamefile.uze", "completefilepath":"gamefile.uze", "ext":"uze"},
  {"filename":"gamedata.bin", "completefilepath":"gamedata.bin", "ext":"bin"}
 ],
 "title": "Title for your game",
 "gamefile": "gamefile.uze"
}

NOTE: completefilepath gets appended to the base directory name that the .json file was downloaded from. It will become a complete file path.

Example Apache .htaccess file contents:

Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "http://www.nicksen782.net"
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "POST, GET, OPTIONS"
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "x-requested-with, Content-Type, origin, authorization, accept, client-security-token"

This .htaccess file should be in the download directory ONLY.
