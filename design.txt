Make very similar to the existing UAM Online Emulator.

Allow for it to be stand-alone (fully) or integrated with UAM when loaded via an iframe.

FEATURES:
	Game loading:
		Load game and game files from DB.
		Load game and game file from user input.
		Load game and game files from JSON url.
	Onscreen controls:
		Simple clickable controls for player1 and for player2.
	Onscreen emulator controls:
		Stop, Reload, Unload
		F2 Quality, F3 Debug, F7 Flicker, F9 Pause, F10 Step
		Auto pause (optional)

Features (UAM ONLY):
	Compile options:
		Load game list from UAM DB.
			Game ids and full path to load the compiled game.
		Individual options to show the full debug output on:
			Failures
			Errors
			Warnings
		Option to start the game automatically after successful compile.
		Compile
		C2BIN
		C2BIN2
	Output:
		Show last and previous compile with:
		date
		game name
		flash and ram usage
		failure count
		error count
		warnings count

Emulator has it's own database. The database is only editable via UAM.

UAM will maintain the same side menu to control the Emulator but it will directly control the iframe views.
